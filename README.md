# generic hashtable
This is an implementation of a generic hash table in C with linear chaining. 
Thus it can accomodate the elements with same hash key.
To use in any work in C/C++, you need to 
1. Define a function that accepts the key type you want to compare
2. Pass it as a parameter to create function

A test program is provided to show how it is used for integer.
